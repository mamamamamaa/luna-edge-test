# Test task

Test task in the company Luna Edge for the position of junior front-end developer.

## Usage

In the about section, you can follow the [link](https://luna-edge-test-alpha.vercel.app/) and test the application, but due to the fact that the OMDB API service provides a link to the API with the HTTP protocol, the browser does not allow the client to send a request to the server. Therefore, pagination on hosting does not work, but you can test it locally. To do this, follow these steps:

Register on the OMDB service, get your API key and in the same place you can get a link to the BASE URL.

### In terminal:
 
* Clone Repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/mamamamamaa/luna-edge-test.git
```

* Install packages:

```
// with npm
npm i 

// with yarn
yarn add   
```

* Create a ".env" file and then add environment variables like in [".env.example"](https://github.com/mamamamamaa/luna-edge-test/blob/main/.env.example) file.

* Run application:
```
// with npm
npm run dev

// with yarn
yarn dev  
```
 
* And finaly go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. ^_^
